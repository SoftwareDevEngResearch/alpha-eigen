# alpha-eigen
Using dynamic mode decomposition to calculate alpha-eigenvalues for time-dependent radiation transport problems.

## Installation
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `pip install alpha-eigen`, which will install the package and its dependencies
3. That's it! You're all set

## Running
You have a few options! 
### Tests
This package is compatible with PyTest, so if you'd like to run the integration test problem, just run `pytest` from the main directory. The configured integration test is the short version; to run the long version, from the main directory, run `mv alpha_eigen_modules/tests/long_kornreich_parsons.py alpha_eigen_modules/tests/test_long_kornreich_parsons.py`. Then, run `pytest`. Both short_ and long_ run the heterogeneous supercritical slab from the Kornreich-Parsons benchmark. 

### Command-Line
This package can be run from the command-line or using an IDE. From the command-line, running `python3 main.py --help` will return a list of available command-line arguments. As of 03/17/2022, those are:

--problem [Problem name]

--length [Slab length]

--cells_per_mfp [Cells per mean free path]

--num_angles [Number of SN angles]

--steps [Number of time-steps to use]

Only --problem is a required argument. If not specified, each input has a default steady-state configuration.


### IDE
From an IDE, you can navigate to the alpha_eigen_modules directory and run inputs.py with your chosen input function activated. 

## Available Examples
Various benchmark slabs from Kornreich, Parsons (2005) 10.1016/j.anucene.2005.02.004 are available for configuration in either steady-state or time-dependent mode, to either calculate the k- or alpha-eigenvalues.
